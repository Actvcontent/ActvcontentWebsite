The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest buzzword describing a variety of global enterprises from wearables to devices for the home or car. Basically, if it’s connected to the internet, it’s part of the new IoT world.

IoT is growing so rapidly that every major company wants a piece of it. [IBM recently announced](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-investment-idUSKBN0MR0BS20150331) a $3 billion investment in IoT over the next 4 years and [Google already spent $3.2 billion](https://abc.xyz/investor/index.html) to acquire smart thermostat company Nest.

According to the Economist, [75% of executives surveyed at large global companies](http://www.arm.com/files/pdf/EIU_Internet_Business_Index_WEB.PDF) claimed to be exploring IoT strategies for their businesses. However, those same executives site a lack of skills and knowledge among employees and management as the largest obstacle to implementing these IoT solutions.

This is not surprising, because implementing an IoT solution requires in-depth knowledge of mobile and cloud computing as well as the ability to produce both the hardware and the software to run it. There aren’t many companies who can deal with both sides of the IoT coin. Instead, solution providers offer clients application agonistic IoT software platforms that can integrate with any hardware. But, who will build this sensor-enabled hardware?

Our unique approach offers hardware, software, and implementation services to our clients. We built an asset tracking solution utilizing Bluetooth Beacon technology that brings together customizable hardware and software that fits many industries and applications.

By offering an end-to-end solution, we are able to create tailored applications that will fit our clients’ needs. We look to close the IoT knowledge gap for our clients as they look for new revenue opportunities from their existing products and services.
